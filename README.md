# DjangoISSProject
A first attempt at using Django to create a locally hosted website that displays information about the international space station.

To run this project. Put all files and folders into a parent folder. 
Navigate to the parent folder in the command line and input *python manage.py runserver*.

You can then view the webpage contents through a browser at http://127.0.0.1:8000/stations/
